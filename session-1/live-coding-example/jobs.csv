Chief Operating Officer - COO,,,,https://aijobs.ai/job/chief-operating-officer-coo,"Fully remote | Complete engagement jobFounded in Palo Alto by Dr. Andrew Ng and Israel Niezen, Factored helps U.S. companies build and scale world-class AI, ML, and Data teams, powered by the top 1% of LATAM talent, with a defining purpose:To empower brilliant humans, unleash their potential, and amplify their impact in the world.At Factored, you’ll be part of a community that values learning, ownership, and authenticity, where your growth is personal and your ideas matter. We’re transparent, curious, and collaborative. We strive for excellence, celebrate diversity, encourage curiosity, and build an environment where you can truly thrive.Factored has been incredibly successful in our first six years by growing organically and by empowering a brilliant and inspired team of AI/data engineers, recruiters, business operations, salespeople, and client delivery folks. This team has thus far been led by a thin management layer made up of a seasoned CFO, a few experienced VPs, and a number of relatively young, but very diligent and hard-working managers and directors who have grown into their roles relatively well so far, without the requisite level of experience many would expect for a company at our stage. Our “magic” has come from a combination of intelligence, passion for what we do, work ethic, speed, urgency, fast problem-solving, transparency, ownership mentality, and empowerment of our high agency teammates at every level to contribute to our mission.We are now in a stage where that magic is still very real and treasured in our organization, but it alone might not be enough to get us to the next objective of 3x growth of our business—and we need to significantly scale before a potential exit. It is time for our third C-level hire after the CEO and CFO. The CEO is currently responsible for many day-to-day negotiations and decisions (both critical decisions and less material decisions) spanning many different areas of the business, and he would be more valuable to the business by devoting more time to building the business, growing sales, assessing strategic opportunities and partnerships, developing new business opportunities and revenue lines, and reinforcing our culture (areas which he considers particular strengths of his). Likewise, our operations and engineering management teams could benefit from more structured leadership—pushing for greater collaboration, effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability across the organization. The CEO is often an inspiring and effective communicator and leader, but he admittedly is not the most organized manager or planner. He and the team need help from a seasoned senior manager who can also help lead the team on most day-to-day efforts, especially when the CEO is away or focused on other strategic areas.Essentially, we are looking for a COO to run the day-to-day business and help us become a self-managed and self-scaling organization that no longer depends so heavily on a few individuals at the top (like our CEO) to make so many decisions across so many different functions. We're seeking someone who combines exceptional intelligence with sharp judgment and an execution-driven mindset. The ideal person should be able to grasp complex situations quickly, make high-quality decisions under ambiguity, and strike a balance between speed and rigor. Ideal candidates should also have helpedgrow and operate a professional services organization to$100M+ in revenue and 1,000+ employees, and understand the operational complexity, people systems, and rigor required at that stage.Functional Responsibilities:Build systems, teams, and processes that scale. Understand that sometimes a quick imperfect solution is needed, while other times we need a more scalable, longer-term solution. You help us strike the right balance and move the ball forward with both short passes and long plays.Build and lead a culture of accountability and data by defining clear and measurable KPIs across the organization, tracking performance, holding teams and leaders accountable for results, and integrating a consistent management system across functions aligned with compensation, promotions, and Factored’s future growth goals.Daily Operations: Lead Factored AI’s day-to-day operations. Enhance structure, organization, and discipline in the company, as well as cross-functional integration. Demonstrate hard work, problem solving, and quick decision making for Factored.Figure it Out. Get it Done: Factored will continue to grow rapidly and will require every person on the team to pull their weight. The COO will be gritty and able to solve problems, properly delegate to their team, and also get their hands dirty.Leadership & Management: Recruit, mentor, and cultivate a stellar team. Give them the tools, leadership, and motivation to innovate and make decisions that support Factored’s vision. Support and allocate resources for an effective organizational structure that balances process, accountability, and scalability with velocity.Resource Allocation: The COO will work closely with the CEO and CFO to set priorities, determine and allocate resources (cost, time, people), and measure outcomes.Setting Direction: The COO will work closely with the CEO to set the short-term and long-term path toward the vision. The COO will be able to see around corners and help skate to where the puck is going.Engaging for Impact: The COO will be adept at leading individuals in the organization toward their line of thinking, getting them bought in, and maximizing the impact of the organization.Budget & Resource Allocation: Collaborate with the CFO and the executive team to define the organizational budget and allocate resources efficiently to meet business objectives.Executive Leadership: Help lead our growing organization while executing with good judgment. Balance and role-model fun and creativity with a professional tone.Recruit other A+ quality performers, and ensure that our team is performing at that level, without allowing B or C level performers to dilute our impact.Qualifications:15+ years of progressive work experience in professional services or a marketplace business, including 5+ years in an executive-level position.Ideal candidates have helped grow and operate a professional services organization to$100M+ in revenue and 1,000+ employees, and understand the operational complexity, people systems, and rigor required at that stage.Prior general management role owning a P&L, managing multiple functions simultaneously.Metrics-driven, with experience analyzing market data/trends to help identify business opportunities.Proven track record of consistently delivering and refining operational efficiencies and organizational structure (roles, responsibilities, repeatable process, cadence, prep for meetings).Ability to generate respect and trust from staff and external constituencies.Experience working with Latin American employees, with an understanding of different country regulations and the ability to manage and grow global teams.Understanding of back-of-the-house operations (finance, people ops, legal).Incredible sense for A+ talent and demonstrated ability to build strong teams.Strong project and people management skills.Strong communication skills, including executive presentations. Able to proactively, clearly, concisely, and consistently provide information to other business leaders that drive decision-making and demonstrate progress toward larger business objectives.Our Benefits:Ownership through equity participation.Competitive salary for top AI & data talent.Annual company retreat.Education bonus for continuous learning.Company-wide winter break.Paid time off.Optional in-person events and meetups.Tailored career roadmaps.High-performance culture.AtFactored, we believe that passionate, smart people expect honesty and transparency, as well as the freedom to do the best work of their lives while learning and growing as much as possible. Great people enjoy working with other passionate, smart people, so we believe in hiring right, and are very selective about who joins our team. Once we hire you, we will invest in you and support your career and professional growth in many meaningful ways. We hire people who are supremely intelligent and talented, but we recognize that intelligence is not enough. Perhaps more importantly, we look for those who are also passionate about our mission and are honest, diligent, collaborative, kind to others, and fun to be around. Life is too short to work with people who don’t inspire you.We are a transparent workplace, where EVERYBODY has a voice in building OUR company, and where learning and growth are available to everyone based on their merits, not just on stamps on their resume. As impressive as some of the stamps on our resumes are, we recognize that human talent and passion exist everywhere, and come from many backgrounds, so stamps matter much less than results. All of us are dedicated doers and are highly energetic, focusing vehemently on execution because we know that the best learning happens by doing. We recognize that we are creating OUR COMPANY TOGETHER, which is not only a high-performing fast-growing business but is changing the way the world perceives the quality of technical talent in Latin America. We are fueled by the great positive impact we are making in the places where we do business and are committed to accelerating careers and investing in hundreds (and hopefully thousands) of highly talented data science engineers and data analysts.In short, our business is about people, so we hire the best people and invest as much as possible in making them fall in love with their work, their learning, and their mission.  When not nerding out on data science, we love to make music together, play sports, play games, dance salsa, cook delicious food, brew the best coffee, throw the best parties, and generally have a great time with each other."

Founded in 2015, the company is one of the fastest growing companies in SaaS, raising approximately $250 million to date and valued at $1.6 billion.Apollo.ioprovides sales and marketing teams with easy access to verified contact data for over 210 million B2B contacts and 35 million companies worldwide, along with tools to engage and convert these contacts in one unified platform. By helping revenue professionals find the most accurate contact information and automating the outreach process,Apollo.ioturns prospects into customers. Apollo raised a series D in 2023 and is backed by top-tier investors, including Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, and more, and counts the former President and COO of Hubspot, JD Sherman, among its board members.The Reality:Being an AI PM isn't sexy. You'll spend hours in spreadsheets evaluating AI outputs, reviewing hundreds of user conversations weekly, and debugging why your research agent just hallucinated a company's tech stack. But when you get it right—when you see adoption explode because sales teams actually trust your AI—it's the most rewarding work in product.Apollo's AI platform powers 54,000+ weekly active users and 130M+ prospecting actions. We've grown AI adoption 5x in the last year by obsessing over something most teams overlook: does our AI actually work when a sales rep needs it to?The Vision:We're building the AI-native operating system for go-to-market teams, anchored by our AI Assistant. Just say ""Find me financial firms in New York that grew headcount 30% last month,"" and the Assistant instantly applies the right filters. Add ""Notify me via Slack and create a call task,"" and it sets up complete workflows in seconds. The Assistant helps reps discover qualified leads, conduct research, and automate outbound—all through natural conversation.Beyond the Assistant, our AI platform powers natural language search, AI-driven research agents, personalized messaging, and ML-powered lead scoring—all designed to help sales teams find the right prospects, deliver messages that resonate, and book more meetings.This role owns AI research, messaging, and context—spanning both the user experience and the underlying infrastructure. You'll define how we surface insights from the web, craft messages that actually convert, and gather the business context that makes AI outputs relevant. From prompt architecture to product UX, you'll shape how sales teams interact with AI across their entire workflow.What You'll Do:Own AI Product Strategy and Vision-Develop and execute a strategic roadmap for AI research, messaging, and context capabilities. Your vision will guide how sales teams leverage AI to understand prospects deeply and engage them with relevance.Elevate AI Research-Enhance Apollo's AI research agents to surface actionable insights from the web—pain points, buying signals, competitive intelligence, and account context. You'll focus on delivering research that helps reps lead with value, not generic personalization.Build Context Systems-Define how AI understands each user's business—their personas, value propositions, target pain points, and competitive positioning. You'll build the context infrastructure that transforms generic AI outputs into relevant, business-aware recommendations.Transform AI Messaging-Own AI-powered messaging tools that create personalized, context-aware emails at scale. You'll improve response rates by ensuring AI matches each rep's authentic voice while incorporating research insights that resonate with prospects.Own AI Quality & Evaluation-Build and scale evaluation infrastructure across accuracy, relevance, clarity, and tone. Nothing ships without hitting quality thresholds. You'll spend time in production data—reviewing real user conversations, identifying failure patterns, and turning them into systematic improvements.Collaborate Across Teams-Partner with engineering, design, prompt writers, and sales to deliver cohesive AI experiences. You'll work closely with domain experts to infuse GTM best practices into every feature and ensure AI outputs match what top performers would actually send.What We're Looking For:Proven AI Product Experience-5+ years in product management, with 2+ years experience launching AI/ML new products and scaling existing products.Track record of shipping AI features that drove measurable business outcomes—not just demos that looked good in meetings.Experience with LLM-powered applications, prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks, and model selection tradeoffs.Founder background is a plus.Technical Depth Without Engineering Hat-Comfortable working in Python/SQL to analyze data, prototype prompts, and evaluate outputs.Understanding of LLM architectures, RAG pipelines, agent frameworks, and inference optimization.Ability to have substantive technical conversations with ML engineers while keeping focus on user outcomes.Obsession with Quality Over Speed-You believe ""ship fast"" means nothing if users don't trust the output.You've built evaluation infrastructure—not just shipped on vibes.You understand that AI adoption follows a trust curve, not a capability curve.GTM or Sales Tech Experience (Strongly Preferred)-Familiarity with sales workflows, prospecting tools, or CRM systems.Understanding of why sales teams are skeptical of AI tools and what it takes to earn their trust.Experience building for SMB users who want results, not complexity.What Will Make You Successful at Apollo:You're comfortable with ambiguity. AI product work means constant iteration—what worked yesterday might not work tomorrow.You lead with data. Every product decision ties back to user behavior, evaluation scores, or business metrics.You're a hands-on builder. You prototype, you evaluate, you debug—you don't just write PRDs and wait.You believe domain expertise beats technical sophistication. The best prompts come from sales experts, not engineers.You move fast without breaking trust. Speed matters, but not at the cost of shipping AI that makes users look foolish.The listed Pay Range reflects base salary range, except for sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commission/sales bonus targets and annual base salary for the role.
